# Structs

r[items.struct.syntax]
```grammar,items
Struct ->
      StructStruct

StructStruct ->
    `struct` IDENTIFIER ( `{` StructFields? `}` | `;` )

StructFields -> StructField (`,` StructField)* `,`?

StructField -> IDENTIFIER `:` Type
```

r[items.struct.intro]
A _struct_ is a nominal [struct type] defined with the keyword `struct`.

r[items.struct.namespace]
A struct declaration defines the given name in the [type namespace] of the module or block where it is located.

An example of a `struct` item and its use:

```rust
struct Point {x: i32, y: i32}
let p = Point {x: 10, y: 11};
let px: i32 = p.x;
```

> [!NOTE]
> Tuple structs are not supported in this specification. Use named-field structs instead, or tuple-like enum variants if positional fields are desired.

r[items.struct.unit]
A _unit-like struct_ is a struct without any fields, defined by leaving off the
list of fields entirely. Such a struct implicitly defines a [constant] of its
type with the same name. For example:

```rust
struct Cookie;
let c = [Cookie, Cookie {}, Cookie, Cookie {}];
```

is equivalent to

```rust
struct Cookie {}
const Cookie: Cookie = Cookie {};
let c = [Cookie, Cookie {}, Cookie, Cookie {}];
```

r[items.struct.layout]
The precise memory layout of a struct is not specified. You should design it yourself.
