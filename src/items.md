r[items.intro]
An _item_ is a component of a crate. Items are organized within a crate by a
nested set of [modules].

r[items.static-def]
Items are entirely determined at compile-time, generally remain fixed during
execution, and may reside in read-only memory.

r[items.kinds]
There are several kinds of items:

* [function definitions]
* [struct definitions]
* [enumeration definitions]
* [constant items]
* [trait definitions]
* [implementations]

r[items.locations]
Items may be declared in the [root of the crate] or a [block expression].

r[items.associated-locations]
A subset of items, called [associated items], may be declared in [traits] and [implementations].

r[items.extern-locations]
A subset of items, called external items, may be declared in [`extern` blocks].

r[items.decl-order]
Items may be defined in any order, with the exception of [`macro_rules`] which has its own scoping behavior.

r[items.name-resolution]
[Name resolution] of item names allows items to be defined before or after where the item is referred to in the module or block.

See [item scopes] for information on the scoping rules of items.
